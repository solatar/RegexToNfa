## Fourth week ##

This week I got stuck and had to leave most of the documentation for Sunday. I've tried to follow Russ Cox's
article mentioned in Requirements Specification but the simulation part was too confusing. Another approach
was to use dfs for simulation but the structure of my Nfa didn't seem to support it.
